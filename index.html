<p>This project is making a simple robot.
It contains both hardware and software design.
The robot is a simple differential drive design using two
small engine form Pololu, a Arduino Uno (R3) and some custom
designed hardware around a HBridge chip.</p>

<p>The first version of the robot have two simple photoresitors
as sensors.</p>

<p>Here will also be some examples and test code. Some of my experiments.
The productions code will be developed in a TDD style, using mostly C++.
I have desided to use CMake, Google test, Google mock and add Andy Browns,
<a href="http://andybrown.me.uk/wk/2011/01/15/the-standard-template-library-stl-for-avr-with-c-streams/">STL library for the Arduino</a>.</p>

<h2> News: </h2>
<h3> 2013-10-31: Hardware redsign stage one </h3>

<p> The hardware is being redesigned, making it more modular. I'm hoping to
have it ready in time for <a
    href="https://frab.fscons.org/en/fscons13/public/events/24">the talk</a> on
<a href="https://fscons.org/2013/">FSCONS 2013</a>.  I have desided to make the
power regulation, with the on switch into a separate board, sending +9v
(arduino power), +6v (engine power) and ground over to a new board i make on a
Arduino Proto Shield.
</p>

<h3> 2013-07-02: Hardware build progressing </h3>
<p> Before the work, and a bit during lunch. I didn't some mounting of hardware.
Now the engines are in place, the Arduino board is screwed on. Even thou i found
out the the M4 screws and distances i found in a drawer was a bit to big for one
of the holes on the Arduino. I have glued on some velcro straps, and a holder for
main power switch.
