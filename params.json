{"name":"Balpbotone","tagline":"","body":"# BalpBotOne\r\n\r\nThis project is making a simple robot.\r\nIt contains both hardware and software design.\r\nThe robot is a simple differential drive design using two\r\nsmall engine form Pololu, a Arduino Uno (R3) and some custom\r\ndesigned hardware around a HBridge chip.\r\n\r\nThe first version of the robot have two simple photoresitors\r\nas sensors.\r\n\r\nHere will also be some examples and test code. Some of my experiments.\r\nThe productions code will be developed in a TDD style, using mostly C++.\r\nI have desided to use CMake, Google test, Google mock and add Andy Browns,\r\n[STL library for the Arduino](http://andybrown.me.uk/wk/2011/01/15/the-standard-template-library-stl-for-avr-with-c-streams/).\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
